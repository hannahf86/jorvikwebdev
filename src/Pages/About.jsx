          <h2 className={textStyles.subtitle}>Why us?</h2>
          <p className="text-center text-white text-lg pb-8">
            Welcome to Jorvik Web Dev! We are small, yet mighty!
          </p>
          <h2 className={textStyles.sectionTitle}>Who Are We?</h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-white text-base ">
            A small team based in the centre of York in the United Kingdom,
            hence &quot;Jorvik&quot;, which was the old name for York, and why
            we have the small lean towards Vikings across our brand.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2 className={textStyles.sectionTitle}>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p className={textStyles.desc}>
            At the heart of Jorvik Web Dev is the belief in kindness and
            helpfulness. Behind every website is a person who wants their goal
            to succeed. We want to use our passion to help boost yours.
            <br />
            <br /> We operate ourselves with care, respect, and genuine
            enthusiasm from small single page applications, to gigantic and
            complex user based e-commerce websites.
            <br />
            <br />
            By approaching each project with empathy, we build not only
            successful digital products but also lasting relationships with our
            clients.

          <h2 className={textStyles.sectionTitle}>Transparency</h2>
          <p className={textStyles.desc}>
            We believe in transparency across every aspect of our business. It
            has been our experience that the field of web design be confusing,
            full of jargon and even hidden costs.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will <strong>never</strong> have any hidden or extra costs after
            the contracts have been signed. The price agreed upon will remain
            the final price of the project (unless of course alterations are
            requested by the client).
            <br />
            <br />
            Our clients are kept in the loop at every stage of the development
            process. We provide clear timelines and regular progress updates, if
            requested.
            <br />
            <br />
            No hidden fees, no surprisesâ€”just straightforward, honest service.
            This commitment to transparency ensures that our clients can make
            informed decisions and feel confident in our partnership.
            <br />
